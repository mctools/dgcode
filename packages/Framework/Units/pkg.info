######################################################################

Package with a few convenience units and constants, mirrored in both C++ and
Python. The values are designed to be mostly compatible with those used in CLHEP
and Geant4, most notably meaning millimetres, nanoseconds, and MeV being
unity. A few constants might differ slightly as we use NIST/CODATA values as the
primary source of data, and there are certainly not as many constants and units
available as in CLHEP.

This package will never have any external dependencies.
