OpenSceneGraph based viewer for Geant4

Note that the included font file, data/RobotoMono_wght_.ttf, file is
deliberately chosen because it has an Apache-2.0 LICENSE like the rest of
dgcode, hence making it simple to include it here (it also needed to be
monospace of course). Specifically it was copied from the file
apache/robotomono/RobotoMono[wght].ttf in the git repo
https://github.com/google/fonts (commit id
4b31e06771036d0132bbcf26dccd976f4fce4286). The LICENSE file in the same
directory of that repo in that commit is the Apache-2.0 license.

todo (random thoughts):
  - in order to potentially make this viewer exportable, it might be valuable to
    not depend on other packages here (decision to be revisited)
  - fps counter?
  - hower-text under cursor (with volume name), transparent gray
  - check all includes and general code cleanup
  - highlight selected node (and nodes with same material, log-vol, shape, etc)
  - test that anti-aliasing works
  - display of e.g. picked point(s) (and line between them with distance label)
  - embedded text info
  - different visual effects? one for selection, one for showing vertices and triangles,
    one for showing all "aluminium" around, etc.
   -special colouring;
     - according to vis-attributes
     - by material, name, etc. (has to be edited - such maps must then be persistifiable
       in editable format)
 - options which would allow e.g. wireframe world and normal daughters
 - iconbox for zapped volumes
 - zoom to clicked volume
  -animated zooms
 - proper material, cubic volume, surface area, weight, etc. printouts
 - simulated particles display
 - options to scale axes and to move them around
 - shortcut for axis aligned views or axis rotations!
 - for super imgs: add user manipulatable light sources and enable shading
 - iconbox idea: one shortcut to flip between de-iconising all iconised volumes
    and iconising all visible volumes. Flip-zap-flip to resurrect a volume.
 - switch perspective and ortographic
 - HUD help screen (and info, toggle on/off with F1)
 - HUD status-bar (toggle on/off with F1)
 - change cursor when in pick-point-mode?
 - "zap" mode which forces into wireframe and makes inactive to picking rather
   than simply hiding
 - cutaways (by phi or plan or wedge...)
 - workaround random FPE problems in osg
 - background colour
 - export images, also with transparent background.
 - save/store up to 10 views
 - click to orient view to normal of selected surface
 - should zap-state be remembered? Right now you can contract+expand a sibling
   and it is forgotten.
 - measurement points: corner-snapping or not should be saved (along with
   surface normals), so we can say give info on (can we easily take into account that
   planes are finite?):
   dist(point1,point2)
   dist(point1,plane2) [if point2 not corner-snapped]
   dist(plane1,point2) [if point1 not corner-snapped]
   dist(plane1,plane2) [if neither points1 are corner-snapped and if planes are
   parallel]
 - ORIENT_TO_SURFACE: If already oriented, then align the rotation with the
   edges of the picked surface (using perhaps primitiveIndex of the Intersection
   struct on the vertex arrays?? Has to remember triangles vs. quads of course)
 - Arrow keys for zoom/rotate, enter for ...? dbl click for...?
 - text/box colour should change with background colour changes
 - scale down font as appropriate in small window (or just set characterheight
   once and for all?). Problems seen in ubuntu in virtualbox on osx.
 - GraphicsWindow/setCursor
 - wheel zoom changes center
 - wheel zoom should also use shift/ctrl to control speed (like arrow up/down)
 - should be able to interact with tracks
