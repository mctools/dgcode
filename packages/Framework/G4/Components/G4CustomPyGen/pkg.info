package(USEPKG G4Interfaces)

####################################################################

Package containing infrastructure to allow people to implement custom generators
in python, for instance right in their simulation scripts.

TODO:
  * gun should accept wavelength parameters
  * gun should accept tuple/list parameters for vectors
  * gun should provide attribute access to parameters (e.g. gun.energy = ...)
  * gun should have a .fire() method, in case user wants to provide multiple
    particles per event (will be triggered once automatically in case user didn't
    invoke it).
  * gun should default to 1.8Aa neutron
  * need test scripts and examples, as well as testing module-resident
  py-generator.
