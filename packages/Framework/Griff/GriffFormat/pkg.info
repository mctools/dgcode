package(USEPKG EvtFile)

######################################################################


Package setting up a Geant4-specific container format for Geant4 event data
based on the EvtFile package.

Note that the package does *not* depend on Geant4, which means that the data can
be read and analysed without complicated dependencies. For that reason,
functionality For writing out the files from within a Geant4 job in the first
place, is provided in a separate package: G4DataCollect. Utilities for reading
and analysing such files are in GriffDataRead and GriffAnaUtils respectively.

TODO:
  * Need scripts for dumping the contents of .griff files.
  * Support file merging. This would require special code since the database
    section is non-trivial to merge (meaning that the track/step sections will be
    as well)
  * needs script which can strip stepdata from a file (also need to be able to
    not record it in the first place)
  * Store seeds in file
