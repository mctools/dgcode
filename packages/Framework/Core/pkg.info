This package is supposed to provide commonly used functionality which a high
number of packages might need. For now we provide a Python.hh file which should
be used for all compiled python modules and we provide light-weight C++ and
python access to Geant4/CLHEP units so these will also be available to anyone
doing work which does not depend on Geant4.

This package will never have any external dependencies.
