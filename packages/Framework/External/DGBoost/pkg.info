######################################################################

This packages includes the few source files extracted from Boost, needed for the
purposes of our python-C++ bindings. For obvious reasons, these files are
therefore distributed under the boost license.

The lenient compilation flags in this case are there to make sure no-one gets
nasty surprises from the boost code in libsrc/ (which is anyway not ours).

This package will never have any external dependencies.
