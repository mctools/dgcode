package()

Geant4-compatible units and constants, copied and modified slightly so they can
be accessed without Geant4 available. In C++ they are available in namespaces
(respectively Units and Constants), and they are available in Python modules as
well. Since this is based on code copied from Geant4, code in this package is
distributed under the Geant4 license.


Despite the name, this package will never have any external dependencies.
