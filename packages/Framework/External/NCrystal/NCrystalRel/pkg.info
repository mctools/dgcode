Special meta-package which due to custom code (hacks?) in dgbuild will get
either "EXTDEP NCrystal" or "USEPKG NCrystalBuiltin" injected as a
dependency. By using NCrystal header files, cmdline scripts, or pythoh modules
through this NCrystalRel package, other dgcode packages can use NCrystal
irrespectively of whether NCrystal exists pre-built on the system, or being
built from the code in the NCrystalBuiltin package (the NCrystalBuiltin is
automatically disabled if there is a system-provided NCrystal installation).
