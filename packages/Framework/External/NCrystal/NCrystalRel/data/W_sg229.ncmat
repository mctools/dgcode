# The VDOS curve was extracted by T. Kittelmann using the engauge digitizer
# software from Figure 2 of:
#
#   "Effect of the variation of the electronic density of states of zirconium and
#    tungsten on their respective thermal conductivity evolution with temperature"

#
# It should be noted that Crocombette-2015 argues that VDOS curve is not perfect
# at higher frequencies. If a more convincing VDOS curve is one day available,
# the one below could be replaced. However, the realism of even a rough VDOS
# curve is much better than the alternative of a Debye spectrum.
