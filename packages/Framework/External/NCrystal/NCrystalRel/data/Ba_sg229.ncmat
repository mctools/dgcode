# VDOS curve at 295K is taken from:
#
#    Oli, B.A. (1988). Microscopic theory of the phonon frequencies in BCC
#    barium (IC--88/322). International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
#
# However, note that the VDOS curve in the reference had almost linear behaviour
# at low E, so we force ~E^2 behaviour below 2.4meV, to not get inflated
# quasy-elastic scattering. This also moves up the derived Debye temperature
# towards the catalogued value (89.6K) derived from the Debye-waller factor at
# 293K compiled in the supplement of Acta Cryst., A52, p. 456-470, 1996.
