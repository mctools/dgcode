"""

Meta-module providing the most commonly needed public API functions and classes
from NCrystal in a single module. It can be used as:

import NCrystalRel as NCrystal.api as NC

Which will for now do the same as "import NCrystalRel as NCrystal as NC". However, it might be
that we will eventually modify the default behaviour to not include anything
when merely doing "import NCrystalRel as NCrystal", so the "import NCrystalRel as NCrystal.api as NC" will be
more stable in the long rum.
