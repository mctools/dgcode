# Neon gas.
#
# Noble gasses such as this one can be modelled realistically using the freegas
# model of NCrystal. The density is the value at STP (273.15K, 1atm) calculated
# with the ideal gas equation. The density value must currently (NCrystal
# v2.7.0) be manually changed by the user if modelling using different
# temperatures or pressures is desired (the formula is given below).

  # Notice: We are hardcoding the STP values (273.15K, 1atm) here. For other
  # values of pressure and temperature, it can be calculated as:
  #
  #      density [kg/m3] = 245.9234 * ( P[atm] / T[K] )
  #
  # Which assumes a Ne mass of 20.1797 amu.
