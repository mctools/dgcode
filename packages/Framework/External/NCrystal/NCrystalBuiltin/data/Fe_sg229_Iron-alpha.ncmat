# Alpha-iron (bcc Fe)
#
# Can be used to model low-carbon steel, where it is the primary phase.
#
# Crystal structure (229, bcc) is well known and available from many
# sources. The only parameter to determine is the lattice parameter, which
# affects d-spacings and material density. We use the temperature-dependent
# parameterisation found in (evaluated at 300K):
#
#    "Lattice Constant of Iron and Austenite Including Its Supersaturation
#     Phase of Carbon", Ichiro SEKI, Kazuhiro NAGATA,
#     ISIJ International, 2005, Volume 45, Issue 12, Pages 1789-1794
#     https://doi.org/10.2355/isijinternational.45.1789
#
# This crystal structure is also compatible with structure obtained from:

#    https://www.crystallography.net/cod/9006588.html
#    https://www.crystallography.net/cod/9013414.html

#
# The VDOS curve was extracted by T. Kittelmann using the engauge digitizer
# software from Figure 5 of:
#
#    "Phonon Dispersion Relation for Iron"
#    V. J. Minkiewicz, G. Shirane, and R. Nathans
#    Phys. Rev. 162, 528 - Published 15 October 1967
#    https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.162.528
#
# The VDOS curve was validated with experimental data in:
#
#    T. S. Toellner, et. al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 71, 2112 (1997)
#    https://doi.org/10.1063/1.120448
#
# Finally it should be noted that the VDOS curve was compared with the one used
# to generate the alpha-Iron scattering kernel in ENDF/B-VIII (which uses a
# distribution due to Stedman, Almqvist, and Nilsson). It is essentially roughly
# compatible in shape, but the Minkiewicz distribution adopted for the present
# NCMAT file is more detailed.
