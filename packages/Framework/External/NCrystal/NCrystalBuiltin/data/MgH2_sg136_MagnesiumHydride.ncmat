#
# MagnesiumHydride (MgH2, tetragonal, SG-136 / P4_2/mnm)
#
# Under usual conditions this phase exists from 0 to 600K.
#
# Structure converted with ncrystal_onlinedb2ncmat from:
#
#    "The Preparation and Some Properties of Magnesium Hydride"
#    Ellinger, F.H., et al. (1955)
#    Crystallography Open Database entry 4124639
#    https://www.crystallography.net/cod/4124639.html
#
# This crystal structure is also compatible with structure obtained from
# https://www.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-23710
#
# Phonon spectrum calculations were performed, by Davide Campi and
# Marco Bernasconi from University of Milano-Bicocca, within Density
# Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) by using the
# Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation to the exchange and
# correlation energy functional. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials and a
# plane wave expansion of Kohn-Sham orbitals up to a kinetic cutoff of
# 60 Ry was employed, as implemented in the Quantum-ESPRESSO package.
#
# In the electronic structure calculations, the Brillouin zone (BZ)
# integration was performed over a uniform Gamma-centered 10x10x14
# k-point mesh.
