# Gamma-iron (austenite, fcc Fe)
#
# In pure iron and at atmospheric pressure, the gamma phase of iron forms at
# 1180K, but might exist at lower temperatures in impure alloys.
#
# Crystal structure (225, fcc) is well known and available from many
# sources. The only parameter to determine is the lattice parameter, which affects
# d-spacings and material density. We use the temperature-dependent
# parameterisation found in (evaluated at 1300K):
