# Phonon spectrum calculations were performed, by Davide Campi and
# Marco Bernasconi from University of Milano-Bicocca, within Density
# Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) by using the
# Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation to the exchange and
# correlation energy functional. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials and a
# plane wave expansion of Kohn-Sham orbitals up to a kinetic cutoff of
# 60 Ry was employed, as implemented in the Quantum-ESPRESSO package.
#
# In the electronic structure calculations, the Brillouin zone (BZ)
# integration was performed over a uniform Gamma-centered 10x10x14
# k-point mesh.
