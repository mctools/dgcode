NCMAT v5
#
# Dysprosium oxide (Dy2O3, cubic, SG-206 / Ia-3)
#
# Under usual conditions this phase exists from 0 to 2681K.
#
# Structure converted with ncrystal_onlinedb2ncmat from:
#
#    "The structure characteristics of the diluted
#     magnetic semiconductor Y2-x Dyx O3"
#    Antic, B., et al. (1993)
#    Crystallography Open Database entry 1539592
#    https://www.crystallography.net/cod/1539592.html
#
# This crystal structure is also compatible with structure obtained from
# https://www.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-2345
#
# The VDOS curves were calculated using Phonopy[1] input files from[2] and
# OCLIMAX[3] software by Kemal Ramic from ESS Spallation Physics group.
