# The VDOS is the same as used to generate the scattering kernels shipped with
# the ENDF/B-VIII release (extracted from the file tsl-crystalline-graphite.leapr).
#
# With the addition of a VDOS curve in NCrystal v2.0.0 and atomic displacements
# based on VDOS in v2.6.0, the performance is in general very good. However, the
# resulting inelastic cross sections at long wavelengths seems to still be too
# low when comparing with (some) measurements, which one can speculate as being
# a sign that the incoherent approximation is not very good for this strongly
# coherently scattering material, and that there are strong coherent effects in
# single-phonon scattering. This might be solved in the future by adding support
# for coherent scattering kernels. The experimental data used for comparison was
# R.B.Walton, et al. (1960, EXFOR id 11359002) and P.A.Egelstaff (1957, EXFOR id
# 21149003). Additionally, part of the remaining discrepancy might also be
# attributed to density fluctuations in the experimentally studied materials,
# leading to a SANS contribution to the measured cross section at long
# wavelengths.
#
# Finally here is "magic comment" which ensures that NCrystal will model this as
# an anisotropic layered crystal, rotated around the third lattice axis:
