package(USEEXT Geant4)

######################################################################

Classes and utilities used to enable the thermal scattering physics shipped with
Geant4, due to Tatsumi Koi (probably not very well supported going forward since
he left Geant4 before v10.5.0 was released).

Note that the class G4HadronElasticPhysicsHP_TS is basically a cut and paste of
the G4HadronElasticPhysicsHP class from Geant4. Only changes are the name, and a
few lines in the .cc, needed to enable the thermal scattering physics.

From time to time we will have to track upstream changes to
G4HadronElasticPhysicsHP, and adapt them as well, to stay in synch.
